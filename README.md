# DM-Ont: Ontology for the Device Management domain

The Device Management domain concerns remote administration of customer devices for an operator, such as a telecommunication operator or device manufacturer. Benefits of Device Management become all the more crucial with the advent of the Internet of Things. However, current traditional solutions, based on a centralized architecture, are not suited anymore. The tremendous explosion of heterogeneous connected objects implies a need for handling heterogeneity of distributed Device Management solutions. In order to tackle this challenge, an ontology modeling the set of common concepts of the domain is proposed, as an extension of the SAREF ontology.

This first version of this model has been published in:
